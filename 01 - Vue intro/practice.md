# Vue intro practice

## Task 1: Fetch and display a post

-   Fetch a single post from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{id}`, where `{id}` comes from a variable.
-   While the request is in progress, display a visible loading message to the user.
-   After the request completes, render the post data.

## Task 2: React to ID changes

-   Make the `id` variable reactive.
-   When `id` changes, automatically refetch the post and update the displayed content.
